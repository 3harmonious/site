This term has other meanings, see the Text (values).
Sample text

Text (from lat. textus-fabric; plexus, combination)-a human thought fixed on some material medium; in General, a coherent and complete sequence of symbols.

There are two main interpretations of the concept of "text": immanent (extended, philosophically loaded) and representative (more private). The immanent approach implies an attitude to the text as an Autonomous reality, aimed at revealing its internal structure. Representative — consideration of the text as a special form of representation of information about the external reality of the text.

In linguistics, the term "text" is used in a broad sense, including samples of spoken speech. Text perception is studied in the framework of text linguistics and psycholinguistics. For example, I. R. Galperin defines a text as follows:"it Is a written message objectified in the form of a written document, consisting of a number of statements United by different types of lexical, grammatical and logical connections, having a certain moral character, pragmatic attitude and, accordingly, literary processing" [1].

The text, in its own way, consists of a certain number of sentences. One sentence, even a very common, complex one, cannot be called a text, because the text can be divided into separate sentences, and the parts of the sentence are combined according to the laws of syntax of a complex sentence, but not the text.

Main thesis-the text consists of two or more sentences.
Semantic integrity of the text
Main item: Coherence (linguistics) and Cohesion (linguistics)

The semantic integrity of the text reflects the connections and dependencies that exist in reality itself (social events, natural phenomena, a person, his appearance and inner world, objects of inanimate nature, etc.).

The unity of the subject of speech is the theme of the utterance. The theme is the semantic core of the text, condensed and generalized content of the text.

The concept of "content of an utterance" is related to the category of informative speech and is inherent only in the text. It informs the reader of the author's individual understanding of the relations between phenomena, their significance in all spheres gives it a semantic integrity.

In a large text, the leading topic is divided into a number of constituent sub-topics; sub-topics are divided into more fractional paragraphs (micro-topics).

The completeness of the utterance is related to the semantic integrity of the text. An indicator of the completeness of the text is the ability to choose a title that reflects its content.

Thus, the following features of the text follow from the semantic integrity of the text:

    A text is a statement about a particular topic;
    The text implements the speaker's idea, the main idea;
    A text of any size is a relatively Autonomous (complete) utterance;
    Sentences are logically linked;
    You can choose a title for the text;
    Properly designed text usually has a beginning and an end.
